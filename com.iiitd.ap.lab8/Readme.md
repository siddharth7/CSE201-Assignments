An Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) is an e-Library website which is part of Library Management System (LMS). You have to design an OPAC system where Customers/ Visitors of the library can search library catalog online to locate various resources - books, periodicals, audio, visual materials and ebook readers. Each copy of a resource has a unique ID. Customers may reserve or release item and manage their account/profile.
 You may go for console based or GUI driven system design- entirely your choice. Description of Use cases:
 Manage Account- Includes functionalities to register user(issue Library ID and Library 6 digit PIN), login and logout.
 Search Catalog- Returns the ID and number of copies available for the result of specified item name or author name.
 Reserve Item- User Reserves the specified item until release called. Reservation only possible if copies available. Admin end should be able to view all the current reserved items but customer can view only his reserved items.
 Release Item- User Releases the specified item.
Design appropriate classes and implement. You are free to design input and output in any possible
format as long as it supports the provided use cases.
Create a main method to demonstrate use of all the use cases.
You must also submit a document giving clear description of all the use cases(their entry/exit condtions etc.). State necessary assumptions in your description.
