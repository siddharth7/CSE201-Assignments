Implement the following generic classes
1. ‘InsertionSorting’ class: Performs Insertion Sort on the array passed as a parameter to a Sort method. The array may be of any primitive data type. Hence, a single generic sort method should support sort function for all these data types.
The class should also have a ‘swaps’ field that tracks the total number of swaps performed while performing the sort.
2. ‘SelectionSorting’ class: Similar to the above class but implements Selection Sort instead. This class should also maintain a ‘swaps’ variable performing the same functionality.
Note:
 The test class, SortTest, is provided which includes the test cases to pass to your implemented sort methods.
 Do not make any changes to the test class.
 The test class also tests the number of swaps taken place while sorting each of the
test case arrays.
Bonus Question:
You are given a bonus test class, BonusSortTest with the provided test arrays to sort and another set of test arrays that contain the number of swaps expected for each of the test arrays to sort.
You have to implement an appropriate generic sorting algorithm in a class called Bonus_sort1. It should pass all the test cases in BonusSortTest. It is one of the standard sorting algorithms.
