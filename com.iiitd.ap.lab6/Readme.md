You have been provided with 20 txt files each containing title, authors and abstract of some research papers.
The user must input an integer k through console.
Followed by inputting value of k, the user should enter an option(0,1,2 or 3) where Option ‘0’ exits the program.
Option ‘1’ should further prompt the user to enter a title. The program should return and display top k frequently occurring words in the abstract of the file that has the entered title. If no such document with the entered title exists, display message: No such document
Option ‘2’ should further prompt the user to enter name of an author. The program should return and display top k frequently occurring words among the abstracts that have been authored by the entered author. If no such document with the entered author exists, display message: No such document
Option ‘3’ should return and display top k frequently occurring words among the abstracts of all the documents.
The program should iteratively ask to enter the option until 0 is entered.
Note: Words are case insensitive so take care of it. Eg. ‘The’ and ‘the’ should both count towards the frequency of the word ‘the’.
You are free to design your class(es) the way you want to.
